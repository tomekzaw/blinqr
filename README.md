# blinqr
A prototype implementation of an unidirectional connectionless stateless data transfer protocol using QR and LT codes to send small files from a computer to a mobile device.

This is a Python version of [Animated QR data transfer with Gomobile and Gopherjs](https://divan.dev/posts/animatedqr/) realised as an assignment for my studies.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7
* Tkinter
* zbar 0.10 (http://zbar.sourceforge.net/download.html)
* DroidCam 6.0 (https://www.dev47apps.com/)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Connect your Android device to the computer using DroidCam 6.0 via USB or Wi-Fi.
2. Launch the sender:
    ```bash
    python sender.py
    ```
3. Select a file to send.
4. Launch the receiver:
    ```bash
    python receiver.py
    ```
   **Note:** If an orange box is displayed instead of the transmitted image, you may need to reinstall DroidCam and restart your computer. This is probably a DroidCam Client issue.
5. Point the camera at the computer screen. Try to keep QR codes in the frame. Each time a QR code is detected, a blue border will appear. Don't worry about dropped frames â€“ blinqr also encodes data using fountain code. That allows data to be recovered from any feasible subset of transmitted QR codes.
6. Wait until the file is received. Transfer speed is about 5 kB/s, but it strongly depends on the computational capabilities of your computer.
7. When the transfer is complete, compare SHA-1 hashes calculated both by sender and receiver for the sake of certainty.
8. Press `q` to exit.

## Further development

**Performance**
* Parallelize QR codes generation
  * Consider switching to other low-level library
* Use RGB QR codes instead of standard QR codes
  * Create a native mobile app to resolve issues with color identification and focusing
* Find optimal combination of block size and data encoding method
* Resolve screen response time issues
  * Consider using a constant frame rate
* Differentiate transmissions by adding transmission ID

**User Experience**
* Improve GUI
* Show progress information and calculate ETA
* Include original file name in the transmission
* Allow sending entire directories by automatically compressing its contents into single .zip archive file

**Refactoring**
* Use Python streams
* Convert into package
  * Provide simple API for sending and receiving files
* Add tests and examples
